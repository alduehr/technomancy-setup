# Technomancy Agent File Schema (v1)

This repo uses YAML agent definition files to configure multi-agent execution.

## Core fields

- `version`: schema version (integer)
- `agent`:
  - `name`: short stable agent id (string)
  - `description`: what the agent does (string, multi-line ok)
  - `owner`: owning team or scope (string)
  - `maturity`: e.g. experimental | beta | critical (string)
- `model`:
  - `provider`: model provider (string)
  - `name`: model id (string)
  - `temperature`: float
  - `max_tokens`: integer
- `prompt`:
  - `system`: system prompt (multi-line string)

## Permissions model (project-agnostic)

Agents are intentionally reusable across projects. Path permissions are **not**
embedded in agent YAML files.

Instead, the repo root contains:

- `AGENT_PERMISSIONS.md`

The Orchestrator and Planner MUST read and obey this file before work begins.
If it does not exist, Orchestrator MUST invoke the Manager agent to create it.

The Manager agent is the only agent allowed to edit `AGENT_PERMISSIONS.md`.
